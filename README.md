# IrisTreeExplorer
This repository contains an implementation of Decision Tree classification on the classic Iris dataset. The project demonstrates:  
. Loading and exploring the Iris dataset  
. Training a Decision Tree classifier
. Performing hyperparameter 
. Tuning using GridSearchCV  
. Evaluating model performance 
. Visualizing tree 
. Making predictions on new data

Key Features

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizes tree parameters like max_depth, min_samples_split, and criterion using GridSearchCV
Model Visualization: Includes code to generate visual representations of the decision tree
Evaluation Metrics: Calculates and displays accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
Prediction Function: Ready-to-use function for making predictions on new iris samples
